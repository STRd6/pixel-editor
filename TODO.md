Simple Replays
--------------

Make sure replays can be saved and loaded

Memory Usage
------------

Reduce memory usage in undo using dirty regions.

Misc
----

Opacity/Alpha

Palette styling, editing palette colors

Preview window on large images

Eye dropper

Multiply events through symmetry so that flood fill and others
can work better with symmetry modes.

Better performance
------------------

Use true size canvas, not enlarged canvas. Avoid lots of pixel manipulation and
let the canvas drawing functions do the work for us. Blit the 'work' canvas onto
the active layer when the command completes.

Never call `repaint` on the whole editor, all the layers should always paint
themselves, and only the regions necessary should be repainted.

Operate directly on imageData arrays where possible.

Better Circle Tool
------------------

Calculate midpoint of [start, end], use that as center and radius as length/2
